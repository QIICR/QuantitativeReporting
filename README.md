# Summary

This is an extension of [3D Slicer](http://slicer.org) to support:

* reading/writing of the selected types of DICOM objects communicating results of quantitative image analysis (this functionality is provided via the integration of the [dcmqi](https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi) library)
* segmentation-based  measurements with DICOM-based import and export of the results.
