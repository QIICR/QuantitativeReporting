# Overview

`QuantitativeReporting` is an [3D Slicer](http://slicer.org) extension to support segmentation-based measurements with DICOM-based import and export of the results. The extension comes with a variety of plugins for loading DICOM Segmentations, Parametric Maps and Structured reports into Slicer.

## Capabilities of `QuantitativeReporting` Include:

* Load a DICOM image series \(CT, MRI\)
* Support of quantitative analysis workflow 
* Interactive image annotation \(use automated segmentation tools of 3D Slicer to VOI\)
* Automatic calculation of VOI-based measurements
* Save quantitative imaging results as a linked collection of DICOM objects: 
  * DICOM Structured Report [TID 1500](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/chapter_A.html#sect_TID_1500) which references:
    * DICOM Segmentation 
* Load and display the volumetric measurements stored using SR
