# Installation

SliceTracker should be available as an extension in the nightly version of 3D Slicer, starting Nov 24, 2016. We always suggest that you use the latest (nightly) version of the software when you try it for the first time.

Download the latest nightly release for your platform from http://download.slicer.org. 

**Do NOT use installers tagged as "Stable Release"!**

Once installation of QuantitativeReporting and dependencies is completed, you will need to restart Slicer application to access the module.

If installation was successful, you should be able to see QuantitativeReporting module in the Slicer module list.
