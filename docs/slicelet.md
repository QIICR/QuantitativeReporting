# QuantitativeReporting Slicelet

A Slicelet[^1] hides the complexity of Slicer's main application user interface. The user interface is limited to those components that are needed for accomplishing the main purpose of the module/extension for which this Slicelet was designed. In other words you can see it as a custom presentation of Slicer which can also reduce the Slicer package size by disabling major components that are not needed for the module.
