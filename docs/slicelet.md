# QuantitativeReporting Slicelet

A Slicelet[^1] hides the complexity of Slicer's main application user interface. The user interface is limited to those components that are needed for accomplishing the main purpose of the module/extension for which this Slicelet was designed. In other words you can see it as a custom presentation of Slicer which can also reduce the Slicer package size by disabling major components that are not needed for the module.  


# Run Quantitative Reporting as a Slicelet

For now it's recommended to clone/download QuantitativeReporting manually from the [github repository] (https://github.com/QIICR/QuantitativeReporting.git). You can either go directly to the web interface and download it or use git[^2] and clone it by means of the cmd(Windows) or terminal(Linux/Mac). 

The following command clones the repository into a subdirectory "QuantitativeReporting" which will be located within the directory from where you executed this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/QIICR/QuantitativeReporting.git
```



Note: Make sure that you installed all dependencies needed by QuantitativeReporting. Otherwise you won't be able to run it.
