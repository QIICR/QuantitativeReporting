# `QuantitativeReporting` Slicelet

A Slicelet[^1] hides the complexity of Slicer's main application user interface. The user interface is limited to those components that are needed for accomplishing the main purpose of the module/extension for which this Slicelet was designed. In other words you can see it as a custom presentation of Slicer which can reduce the Slicer package size and shorten the startup time as well by disabling major components that are not needed for the module.  

# Run `QuantitativeReporting` as a Slicelet

For now it's recommended to clone/download `QuantitativeReporting` manually from the [github repository] (https://github.com/QIICR/QuantitativeReporting.git). You can either go directly to the web interface and download it or use git[^2] and clone it by means of the cmd(Windows) or terminal(Linux/Mac). 

The following command clones the repository into a subdirectory `QuantitativeReporting` which will be located within the directory from where you executed this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/QIICR/QuantitativeReporting.git
```

**Note**: Make sure that you installed all dependencies needed by `QuantitativeReporting`. If you are using a recent nightly build of Slicer you could install `QuantitativeReporting` from the Extension Manager where all dependencies will get installed with it.

## Add Repository to Slicer Application Settings

In order to make your local `QuantitativeReporting` available in Slicer you will need to **add the subdirectory "Py"** to your Slicer application settings as described in the following subsections.

#### Go to "Edit" and Open "Application Settings":

#### Navigate to the Modules Settings:

#### Remove Unneeded `QuantitativeReporting` Module

In case that you installed a version of `QuantitativeReporting` with the aid of the Extension Manager, you will need to remove the paths which has been automatically added to the Slicer application settings. 

1. Look for a path that includes `QuantitativeReporting` in its name
2. Click onto the path that you would like to get removed from the list
3. Push button "Remove" for removing the selected path

#### Add Local `QuantitativeReporting` Module

The last step is to add your locally downloaded/cloned `QuantitativeReporting` to Slicer. Just click "Add" and navigate to the root directory of your local version. Furthermore you will need to select the subdirectory **"Py"** since this directory holds all important source files for the module.

## Mac OS X
